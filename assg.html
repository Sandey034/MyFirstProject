    <h2><strong>What is CSS?</strong></h2>

    <p>
      CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to style and lay out web pages â€” for example, to alter the font, color, size, and spacing of your content, split it into multiple columns, or add animations and other decorative features.

    </p>

    <h2>CSS and HTML</h2>
    <p>Not just a language all its own, CSS is a part of HTML. The first version of HTML to include CSS was HTML 4.0

      CSS was added to HTML to solve a particular problem - the problem of the content of HTML documents not being separated from the layout of the documents. This problem arose when the two most popular web browsers (Netscape and Internet Explorer) continuously added new tags and attributes to the HTML specification. Without the use of formatting tags, the layout of an HTML document was supposed to be taken care of by web browsers. The original purpose of HTML tags was to specify the content that will appear on webpages, and not their layout. But this was no longer the case, as Netscape and Internet Explorer added to the HTML specification.

      <h2>What can be done with CSS?</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Specify a background color-  You can specify a background color for a webpage, a table, a form element, a paragraph, and more.
        </li>
        <li>Specify a common style for one tag or a set of tags. - For example, you can specify that all text declared with the "h2" tag should be blue or that all text declared with the "p" (paragraph) tag should be bold and in a Courier font.
        </li>
        <li>Specify the distance between elements - For example, you can specify how much distance between the top most point of a page and the first element that appears on it there should be or the line spacing in a paragraph.
        </li>
        <li>
          Specify the appearance of links - For example, you can specify that an unvisited link should be blue and not underlined, when the user moves the mouse over a link it should have a gray background and be underlined, and visited links should be green.
        </li>
        <li>
          Specify multiple styles for various webpages - You can have one stylesheet definition that can be used on several webpages instead of redefining the style on each individual page. For example, if you want the links on several of your pages to be green, you can specify this in one external stylesheet definition, and upload it to the pages where you want this particular style to take effect. Once you want to make a change to the stylesheet definition, you can do so in the stylesheet, and the changes will appear automatically on all the pages that the stylesheet has been uploaded to.
        </li>
      </ul>
