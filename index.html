  <h1 class="underline">Introduction to HTML</h1>

  <p>
    HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the code that is used to structure a web page and its content. For example, content could be structured within a set of paragraphs, a list of bulleted points, or using images and data tables. 
    
    <br />
    <br />
    
    It was invented by Physicist Tim Berners-Lee, the first version was published in 1993.

  <h2 id="Define-HTML" class="underline">So what is HTML?</h2>

  <p>
    HTML is a <strong>markup language</strong> that defines the structure of your content. HTML consists of a series of <em>elements</em>, which you use to enclose, or wrap, different parts of the content to make it appear a certain way, or act a certain way. The enclosing tags can make a word or image hyperlink to somewhere else, can italicize words, can make the font bigger or smaller, and so on.  For example, take the following line of content.

  <p>The main parts of an HTML elements are as follows:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <strong>The opening tag:</strong> This consists of the name of the element (in this case, p), wrapped in opening and closing angle brackets. This states where the element begins or starts to take effect — in this case where the paragraph begins
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>The closing tag:</strong> This is the same as the opening tag, except that it includes a forward slash before the element name. This states where the element ends — in this case where the paragraph ends. Failing to add a closing tag is one of the standard beginner errors and can lead to strange results
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>The content:</strong> This is the content of the element, which in this case, is just text
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>The element:</strong> The opening tag, the closing tag, and the content together comprise the element
    </li>
  </ol>
